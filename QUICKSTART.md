## 🎮 First Steps

### 1. **Enable 3D View** (Default)
Look at the header — you'll see a **"3D VIEW"** button. It should already be active (highlighted in cyan).

### 2. **Control the 3D Camera**
- **Rotate**: Left mouse + drag
- **Pan**: Right mouse + drag
- **Zoom**: Scroll wheel

### 3. **Try These Commands** (in the chat panel on the left):

#### Create a Scenario:
```
create evacuation scenario
```

#### Test What-If:
```
what if north bridge collapses?
```

#### Optimize:
```
optimize flow
```

#### Check Status:
```
show status
```

#### Get Help:
```
help
```

## 🎯 Quick Demo Sequence

Try this 30-second demo:

1. Type: `create evacuation scenario`
   - Watch the 3D city appear
   - See particles flowing from residential zones to hospitals

2. Type: `what if north bridge collapses?`
   - Watch routes turn red
   - See traffic reroute
   - Notice congestion increase

3. Type: `optimize flow`
   - See system analyze bottlenecks
   - Watch capacity increase
   - Observe congestion reduce

4. Type: `show status`
   - Get detailed metrics
   - See improvement numbers

## 🎨 What You're Seeing

### Node Shapes (3D Objects):
- **Cones** = Residential zones (sources)
- **Cylinders** = Hospitals (destinations)
- **Octahedrons** = Junctions/Bridges

### Colors:
- **Green** = Normal (< 70% capacity)
- **Yellow** = Warning (70-90% capacity)
- **Red** = Critical (> 90% capacity)
- **Cyan** = Active flow paths

### Moving Particles:
- **Cyan trails** = People/goods flowing through network
- **Speed** = Flow rate
- **Disappear** = When route blocked

## 📊 Metrics Panel (Top Right)

Real-time data showing:
- **Throughput**: Flow rate
- **Risk Level**: Critical nodes
- **Congestion**: Bottleneck count
- **Status**: System health

## 🗣️ Natural Language Tips

The AI understands context! Try:
- "Create a hospital scenario"
- "Load supply chain"
- "Remove south bridge"
- "Fix the system"
- "Start simulation"
- "Reset everything"

---

## 🎬 Three Scenarios Available

1. **Evacuation** (Default)
   - City with 2,350 people
   - 3 hospitals
   - 2 critical bridges

2. **Hospital ER**
   ```
   load hospital scenario
   ```
   - Patient flow simulation
   - Triage system
   - Treatment areas

3. **Supply Chain**
   ```
   create supply chain
   ```
   - Warehouse to stores
   - Distribution network
   - Inventory flow

## 🔄 Toggle Between 2D and 3D

Click the **"3D VIEW"** / **"2D VIEW"** button in the header to switch!

---

## 🎊 That's It!

You're ready to explore. The simulation is physics-based and responds to your commands in real-time.

**Have fun testing scenarios!** 🚀

---

## ⚡ Pro Tips

1. **Rotate the view** to see the network from different angles
2. **Watch the particles** to understand flow direction
3. **Use optimization** after creating bottlenecks
4. **Try the demo button** in the chat panel for an automated sequence
5. **Check metrics** to quantify improvements
